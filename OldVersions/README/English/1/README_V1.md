## General description

SVG video is a video format based on the SVG specification. It is designed to have vector videos, videos that can easily be upscaled, allow embedded interactions, allow source code edits, and be highly compressed and take up significantly less space than files in MP4, MKV, WebM, or other formats. It is not to be confused with SVG animations.

There is 1 drawback to the format:

- [ ] It is expected to be very difficult to program (both the SVG video player, and the SVG video format and generator/recorder)

SVG videos use the `*.svg_video` and `*.svg_vid` file extensions.
